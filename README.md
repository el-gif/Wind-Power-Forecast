This repository contains the source code of the web app [Wind Power Forecast](https://windpower-bjadbff2cwdsgggj.germanywestcentral-01.azurewebsites.net), allowing users to view the forecasted wind energy for existing wind power plants in Europe and to access these forecasts. A detailed documentation including used data sources is provided in the web app. The wind power plant database is not publicly available and is therefore not included in this repository.
